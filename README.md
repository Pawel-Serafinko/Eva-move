# Eva-move
While learning CSS, I did a lot of projects, but I didn't find one that would be a challenge for me. I decided to make a project that seemed impossible to me, to reproduce the graphics using only HTML and CSS. And I did IT :) For a better effect, I enriched the project with animation.

## What I have learned and what obstacles I encountered
The challenge was to achieve sphericality and reflections and shadows. To achieve the desired effect I needed many layers, and to limit the HTML code I used many pseudo-elements in CSS. The key properties were (border-radius, background-image and box-shadow).
